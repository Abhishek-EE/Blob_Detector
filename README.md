# Blob_Detector
Implemented Blob Detection for images using Laplacian of Gaussian. Created a Laplacian Scale space by varying image size which helped increase the speed, Performed Harrisâ€™ Non-Max Suppression and encircled the Blobs.
This is the code from my ECE-558, Digital Imaging Systems, Final Project. To undersatand the working of the project read Arsingh3_Project04_Report.pdf.
To run the project open the Arsingh3_project04_code folder and run the main_function.m file.
